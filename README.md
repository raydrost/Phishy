# Phishy
Repository for the Phishy chrome extension and associated code.

Phishy is a machine-learning-powered chrome extension that detects and flags phishing emails in gmail. At this point, Phishy is not available on the chrome web store, as we are working on securing hosting for the Phishy API.

You can run the chrome extension by hosting the API locally.
